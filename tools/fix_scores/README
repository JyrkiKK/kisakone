How to relatively safely delete bad scores:
-------------------------------------------

1. Use lookup_playerid.sh to find the exact player_id of affected player
  $ ./lookup_playerid.sh "Tuomo Tanskanen"
  Make note of the 'player_id' field

2. Use lookup_roundid.sh to find exact round id where the scores are bad
   (You should know the which round (as in 1,2,3,4) has bad score for these players from Kisakone)
  $ ./lookup_roundid.sh "Parigolf SM-kilpailu Avoin"
  Make note of the RIGHT id, named 'Round'

3. Use lookup_badscore.sh to verify results are shady
  $ ./lookup_badscore.sh player_id round_id

4. Use delete_sadscore.sh to delete the results
  $ ./delete_badsore.sh player_id round_id

5. Re enter scores in Kisakone
